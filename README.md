# node-mongodb-api
EJS templated user CRUD interface with previously created company info API built using Node, Express, MongoDB Atlas, and Mongoose
 
This iteration of my company data API project adds a simple user interface view offering pages to view, add, update and delete information for a fictional company.

My intention is to replace this interface with one developed using React and Bootstrap 4 - so I've only done the most basic styling for this implementation.
